Questions:
Explain the concept of deployment in your own words.
Deployment refers to the process of distributing and activating software across an IT infrastructure. This typically involves moving
 software from a development, where it was created and tested, to a production environment, where it can be accessed and used by
 its intended users. Also it needs testing, and releasing, to ensure the software functions correctly in its new environment.

What are environment variables?
Environment variables are values that provide a way to set dynamicvalues for our environment that can affect the way running 
processes will behave on a computer. For example, environment variables can store data like system paths, user settings, or 
configuration details that are necessary for certain applications to function
 correctly. These variables are especially useful for managing settings that need to vary between different deployment environments (like
 development, testing, and production) without changing the application's code.

What is the filename of the file where environment variables are traditionally stored?
.env (our class). And the bashrc is also used very widely.

What is the network protocol we use to access servers?
HTTP

Explain the concept of clustering in your own words.
Clustering refers to the practice of grouping multiple servers or computers together so they function as a single system. This configuration
 is primarily used to improve performance and availability. By connecting multiple machines, clustering allows for the workload to be 
distributed across several nodes, reducing the strain on any single machine and enhancing the overall processing capacity of the system.

Explain the concept of load balancing in your own words.

Load balancing is a technique used to distribute incoming network traffic or computing tasks across multiple servers or resources in a network.
 The primary goal of load balancing is to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck, thus improving responsiveness and increasing 
the availability of websites or applications.
